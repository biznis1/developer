     <p>  bulksms.ae does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you unless you decide to provide information to us. If you decide to request more information from us, or sign up for our services, we will ask you to provide information such as your name, email address, and other additional information so that we can respond to your request.

This ensures that you are able to seamlessly surf both private and public areas of this website.</p>

<p>Cookies are text files that are attached to your computer’s browser (like MS Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to help us understand your online activities. A cookie by itself does not tell your email address or personally identifiable information.</p>
